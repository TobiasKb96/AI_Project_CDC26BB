We used our already pre-trained info and stopped it in order to see if the plot works of the learning curve and were hoping it would add data to the summary.json
We found out, that the summary.json is rewritten with every new epoch start but it is unclear with what data.
We had 23 epochs no in final running, but more data inside the summary.json but it was not the mix of both epoch runs.
